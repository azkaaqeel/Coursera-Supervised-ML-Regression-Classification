### Key Points:

1. **One-hot encoding creates redundancy**
    
    - When you encode a categorical variable with kkk categories using kkk dummy variables, one of them is redundant because it can be inferred from the others (e.g., if the first 49 variables are all 000, the 50th must be 111).
    - To avoid this redundancy, we usually drop one dummy variable (the "default level") during preprocessing. This ensures a unique solution for linear models and reduces multicollinearity.
2. **Multiple valid models can exist**
    
    - Since the redundant variables provide overlapping information, models like linear regression may yield multiple equivalent solutions with different coefficient values. This is less of an issue for accuracy but can make **interpretation problematic** in models where coefficients matter.
3. **Advantage: Each feature corresponds to a category**
    
    - A significant benefit of one-hot encoding is clarity. Each dummy variable directly maps to a specific category, making it easy to interpret their impact in a model. For example, the variable `State_California` clearly represents the presence of California in the dataset.
4. **When a complete set of dummy variables is useful**
    
    - In some cases, keeping all kkk dummy variables (even with redundancy) is preferred. For example:
        - When interpretability is more critical than redundancy removal.
        - When the model can handle redundancy effectively (e.g., tree-based models).
5. **Tree-based models benefit from the full set of dummies**
    
    - Models like **decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting** are not affected by redundancy in one-hot encoding. These models split data based on thresholds (e.g., "Is `State_California` equal to 1?").
    - Keeping the full set of dummy variables ensures that the splits can **fully leverage all categories** and be more interpretable.
        - Example: A decision tree might split on `State_California` at one level and then on `State_Texas` at another. Dropping a dummy variable (default level) might make it harder to fully encode all categories in the tree.
6. **Recommendation for tree-based models**
    
    - When using tree-based models, it is typically **recommended to retain the full set of dummy variables** (including all categories). Redundancy does not harm these models, and the interpretability of splits improves since all category-related information is preserved.
