By initializing the `DecisionTreeClassifier` with these parameters, you are configuring the model to balance between complexity and generalization. The parameters help control the behavior of the tree to avoid overfitting while still capturing the essential relationships in the data. Hereâ€™s a summary of the potential impacts of these parameters:

- **`criterion`**: Affects how the quality of splits is measured; can impact model performance.
- **`max_depth`**: Limits tree complexity, helping to prevent overfitting.
- **`min_samples_split`**: Ensures a minimum number of samples before splitting, adding robustness.
- **`min_samples_leaf`**: Requires a minimum number of samples in each leaf, promoting smoother predictions.
