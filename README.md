 **Obsidian settings for GitHub-friendly notes**

To make sure pasted images render on GitHub (i pushed and identified that wikilinks won't be rendered by github, so these are the settings that will help you, for the images i had already pasted i ran a python script in bash to change them to standard markdown style):

1. Go to **Settings → Files & Links**
   - Turn **off**: “Use [[Wikilinks]]”
   - **New link format** → *Relative path to file*
   - **Default location for new attachments** → `attachments/`
   - Enable **Automatically update links**

With these settings:
- New images are inserted as standard Markdown links, e.g.  
  ```markdown
  ![](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250819201114.png)
